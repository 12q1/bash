This repository contains several bash scripts that automates tasks / installs apps / edits configurations based on my preferences and workflow.

You are free to use them however you like but be aware that running random scripts from the internet is NOT advisable. 

Some of these scripts may seriously damage your system. Always check the file, creation date and comments thoroughly. Make sure you understand what you are doing before you run them.

I will sometimes update or maintain them but will not take any responsibility for damage.

If you would like to make suggestions or modify something feel free to get in touch.
